<p class="BodyFont">IC is a development tool and tooling environment that will allow   customers to efficiently develop and deliver high quality voice agent and call center applications. IC   was designed with these key factors in mind:</p><ul>

<p class="BodyFont"><strong>Is easy to use:&nbsp;</strong> This Next Generation Development Tool aids   application development by providing task-oriented components for developing   application solutions, such as graphical editors for developing a call-flow, or   specific views and editors to facilitate creation of application elements.</p>
<p class="BodyFont"><strong>Targets developers:&nbsp;</strong> This development tool supports VUI   developers with familiarity of telephony applications while at the same time   abstracting the technical details of implementation languages like VoiceXML. The   tool also supports developers implementing server-side Java Interfaces.</p>
<p class="BodyFont"><strong>Provides extensibility and open architecture development:&nbsp;</strong> While   providing VUI and telephony specific enhancements, the development tool also   seamlessly allows industry standard technologies and practices to be an integral   part of the application delivery process or end-solution. Among the implications   of this guiding principle are requirements such as Eclipse, version control,   server-side programming including Java Servlet, and support for XML   technologies.</p>
<p class="BodyFont"><strong>Allows software reuse:&nbsp;</strong> Developers can easily incorporate   existing application components including those developed through alternate   environments and developers can create shareable components.</p></ul>
